# Dr. Curt #

Dr. Curt is a program composed of three different modules. There is the grammar component, the diagnosis logic component, and the discourse engine component. Each component has a team that is working on the different formulas to complete the Dr. Curt program. Overall, the goal of Dr. Curt is to be able to diagnose patients based on the symptoms that are presented to the program.

## Discourse Engine ##

Basically, the Discourse Engine Team is the prime team that oversees that the other two components are working together to accomplish the goal of Dr. Curt. The program starts with Dr. Curt introducing himself and then asking the user/patient for their symptoms. In general, the Discourse Engine prompts the user to report symptoms to the program. After the user enters their symptoms, the Diagnosis Team takes the symptoms and works to make a diagnosis. The third task of the Discourse Engine Team begins by asking the Diagnosis Team to give a symptom that will help find a diagnosis. The user then replies with a yes or no answer, which relays back to the Diagnosis Team to have Dr. Curt give an output. Based on the output from the Diagnosis Team, the Grammar Team needs to parse the input from the user and put it into logic that Prolog will understand. At this point, the Discourse Engine Team checks to make sure that the questions given by the Grammar Team are able to be handled by Prolog. This goes into a continuous loop until the symptoms are diagnosed or the symptoms cannot be diagnosed.

## Grammar ##

The Grammar Team is involved in converting the logical format of what the Diagnosis Team uses into and out of English.  The Diagnosis Team makes a list of possible symptoms and diseases and sends them to the Grammar Team to convert into a grammatical and logical format that the program understands.  The English grammar has to include questions and declarative statements.  The current list of supported sentences is at EnglishSentences.  In essence, the Grammar Team develops a predicate for translating Logic to English and another predicate for translating English to Logic.  The predicate for converting English to Logic is english(Words,Logic) and the predicate for converting Logic to English is benglish(Logic,Words).

## Diagnosis Logic ##

The Diagnosis Logic Team is essentially the backbone of Dr. Curt.  The Diagnosis Team takes the information and interprets the logic of what the user inputs using natural language. The information is used to determine which symptoms occur most often, which leads to prompting the Grammar Team to ask the next question. The prompts between the Diagnosis Team and the Grammar Team are handled by the Discourse Engine Team.  All in all, the Diagnosis Logic Team takes the semantics of the diseases and tells the Grammar Team what to output. There are four crucial predicates.  The first one is askAbout(Symptom), where Symptom is the most common symptom remaining. The second is pruneDiseases(Symptom, TrueOrFalse), which the Discourse Team uses to tell the Diagnosis Team whether the patient does indeed have the symptom they just asked about; TrueOrFalse will be the atom ‘true’ or ‘false’. The third is diseasesLeft(Num); this tells how many possible diseases remain based on the symptoms described. When there is one disease left, the Discourse Team retrieves the last disease by calling the fourth predicate, disease(Name,Symptoms).
