_Internal User Documentation for Dr. Curt_

= Overview =

Dr. Curt is a program that diagnoses diseases

= Flow =

1.	The program begins with Dr. Curt introducing himself to the user

2.	The user inputs their symptoms in a free form format 

3.	The user then responds to Dr Curt's questions based on the symptoms that were presented (may repeat several times) 

4.	Dr. Curt diagnoses the user with a disease if possible

= Guide to English that Dr Curt Understands =

The user can only phrase their symptoms as, “I have…”, “I am (adjective)”, “I feel…”.  Dr. Curt does not understand phrases that are in the past tense, or anything out of first person and nothing in the progressive tense, however there are a few exceptions.  The program does not use personal pronouns, such as "my", and "your".  When a noun is used as an adjective, Dr. Curt encodes it as a noun, for example in the sentence, "I have body pain.", "body pain" is encoded as a single noun, instead of adjective: "body", noun:  "pain".  Refer to the complete list of sentences that are acceptable to the program.  [http://code.google.com/p/drcurt/wiki/EnglishSentences EnglishSentences]

= Errors/Disadvantages =

If the program will continue to grow, and Prolog will need to be able to overcome the bottle-neck effect and not limit the user as to ways they can describe their symtoms.  There is a trade off between the degree of how the user describes their symptoms and the complicity of the program.  Dr. Curt does not encode personal pronouns and will result in a failure to answer the user's questions.
